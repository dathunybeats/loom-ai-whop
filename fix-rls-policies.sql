-- Fix RLS policies for projects table to allow INSERT operations

-- Drop the existing problematic policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own projects" ON projects;

-- Create separate policies for different operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own projects" ON projects
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own projects" ON projects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own projects" ON projects
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own projects" ON projects
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
